--Home Try-On Funnel:

Warby Parker’s purchase funnel is:

Take the Style Quiz → Home Try-On → Purchase the Perfect Pair of Glasses

During the Home Try-On stage, we will be conducting an A/B Test:

50% of the users will get 3 pairs to try on
50% of the users will get 5 pairs to try on
Let’s find out whether or not users who get more pairs to try on at home will be more likely to make a purchase.

The data will be distributed across three tables:

quiz
home_try_on
purchase
Examine the first five rows of each table
